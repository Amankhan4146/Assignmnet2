# Python Programs: Basic Control Flow and Loop Tasks

This repository contains beginner-level Python solutions for two fundamental programming tasks: checking even/odd numbers and summing a range using loops.

---

## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

### Description
This Python program takes an integer input from the user and checks whether it is even or odd using an `if-else` conditional statement. It then prints the result accordingly.


---

## Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

### Description
This Python script uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 50 and calculates the sum of all integers in that range. The final result is displayed to the user.
